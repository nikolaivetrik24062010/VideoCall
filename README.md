# VideoCall
This GitHub repository showcases an Android video chat application built using the StreamVideo SDK. The application offers a seamless video calling experience, complete with camera control, microphone control, and a user-friendly interface created with Jetpack Compose.
Key Technologies and Principles Demonstrated:

StreamVideo SDK: The project effectively utilizes the StreamVideo SDK for video communication, leveraging its features for real-time chat functionality.

Jetpack Compose: The app's user interface is constructed using Jetpack Compose, Google's modern Android UI toolkit, which simplifies UI development and enhances the app's overall user experience.

Coroutines: Kotlin Coroutines are employed to manage asynchronous tasks, ensuring smooth interactions within the app.

Android Lifecycle: The Android Lifecycle components are used to manage the app's UI components and handle their lifecycle events efficiently.

Dependency Injection: While not explicitly shown in this snippet, for a production-ready app, you would typically employ a dependency injection framework like Dagger or Hilt for better code organization and maintainability.

Error Handling: The code snippet demonstrates robust error handling, ensuring that any issues during the video call setup are properly managed and user-friendly error messages are displayed.

UI Customization: The app's UI is customized using Jetpack Compose modifiers and themes to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.

This repository serves as a starting point for building your own video chat application using the StreamVideo SDK and modern Android development practices. Contributions, bug fixes, and feature enhancements are welcomed through pull requests.
